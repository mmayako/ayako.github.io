As a debt to the many grad students who posted about their grad application journey, I’d like to share all the resources and advice I’ve accumulated over the past year. 

I found it super helpful to read other people’s essays so I’ve done quite a bit of free SOP reviews over the past year. If you’d like for me to take a look at your SOP/CV, just shoot me an email.
