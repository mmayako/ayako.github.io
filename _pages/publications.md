## Undergraduate Research Projects
### Quantum Magnetic Imaging -- Winter 2021 to Spring 2021
In winter 2021, I joined Prof. Mark Ku’s lab group, where we used quantum magnetic imaging techniques to characterize 2D magnetic flakes. I did the hands-on work of building our quantum sensor system based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. We published this work in 2D Materials as [_“Revealing room temperature ferromagnetism in exfoliated Fe5GeTe2 flakes with quantum magnetic imaging.”_](http://mmayako.github.io/files/revealing-room-temp.pdf) 

### Age Structured Population Models Applied to Tissue Dynamics -- Summer 2020
In summer 2020, I was UD Summer Research Scholar working with Prof. Gilberto Schleiniger and Dr. Bruce Boman. For my project, I used MATLAB to find numerical solutions for age-structured population models. I then used these models to predict how retinoic acid (RARɑ), a metabolite responsible for cell maturation, influences the progression of colorectal cancer.


### Electronic Confinement in Quantum Dots -- Fall 2018 to Winter 2020
I joined Prof. Zubaer Hossain’s lab group in fall 2018. I optimized the shape and composition of SiGe and InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) to improve the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells. For this, I learned how to use COMSOL and MATLAB to compute solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation using the finite element method. I also extended this work through a cluster QD array project during an internship at UD’s Energy Research Institute. My efforts culminated in several presentations, including one at the APS April 2020 meeting, and two manuscripts.
