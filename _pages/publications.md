<!-- Van der Waals (vdW) material Fe5GeTe2, with its long-range ferromagnetic ordering near room temperature, has significant potential to become an enabling platform for implementing novel spintronic and quantum devices. To pave the way for applications, it is crucial to determine the magnetic properties when the thickness of Fe5GeTe2 reaches the few-layers regime. However, this is highly challenging due to the need for a characterization technique that is local, highly sensitive, artifact-free, and operational with minimal fabrication. Prior studies have indicated that Curie temperature T C can reach up to close to room temperature for exfoliated Fe5GeTe2 flakes, as measured via electrical transport; there is a need to validate these results with a measurement that reveals magnetism more directly. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of exfoliated thin flakes of vdW magnet Fe5GeTe2 via quantum magnetic imaging technique based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. Through imaging the stray fields, we confirm room-temperature magnetic order in Fe5GeTe2 thin flakes with thickness down to 7 units cell. The stray field patterns and their response to magnetizing fields with different polarities is consistent with previously reported perpendicular easy-axis anisotropy. Furthermore, we perform imaging at different temperatures and determine the Curie temperature of the flakes at ≈300 K. These results provide the basis for realizing a room-temperature monolayer ferromagnet with Fe5GeTe2. This work also demonstrates that the imaging technique enables rapid screening of multiple flakes simultaneously as well as time-resolved imaging for monitoring time-dependent magnetic behaviors, thereby paving the way towards high throughput characterization of potential two-dimensional (2D) magnets near room temperature and providing critical insights into the evolution of domain behaviors in 2D magnets due to degradation. -->

## Undergraduate Research Projects
### Quantum Magnetic Imaging -- Winter 2021 to Spring 2021
In winter 2021, I joined Prof. Mark Ku’s lab group, where we used **quantum magnetic imaging** techniques to characterize **2D magnetic flakes**. I did the hands-on work of building our quantum sensor system based on **nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds**. I later used **MATLAB** to simulate the magnetic field generated by the system when observing samples. We published this work in 2D Materials as [_“Revealing room temperature ferromagnetism in exfoliated Fe5GeTe2 flakes with quantum magnetic imaging.”_](http://mmayako.github.io/files/revealing-room-temp.pdf) 

### Age Structured Population Models Applied to Tissue Dynamics -- Summer 2020
In summer 2020, I was **UD Summer Research Scholar** working with Prof. Gilberto Schleiniger and Dr. Bruce Boman. For my project, I used MATLAB to find numerical solutions for **age-structured population models**. I then used these models to predict how **retinoic acid (RARɑ)**, a metabolite responsible for cell maturation, influences the progression of **colorectal cancer**. My model showed that high RARɑ environments fared better in the long run, matching experimental results. This was significant since metabolites degrade quickly outside the body, making physical experiments unreliable. 


### Electronic Confinement in Quantum Dots -- Fall 2018 to Winter 2020
I joined Prof. Zubaer Hossain’s lab group in the fall of 2018. I worked with a graduate student to investigate the core properties of **alloyed quantum dots (QDs)** to improve the energy conversion efficiency of **solar cells**. I then started my own project where I **optimized the shape and composition** of SiGe and InGaAs **heterostructures** to **maximize confinement potential**. For this, I learned how to use **COMSOL** and **MATLAB** to compute solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation using the **finite element method**. Since previous work studied isolated heterostructures, I independently extended this work through a **cluster QD array** project during an internship at **UD’s Energy Research Institute**. For this, I took advantage of the XSEDE **high performance computing** workshops to optimize my code. My efforts culminated in several presentations, including one at the **APS April 2020 meeting**, and two manuscripts.
