Hello! I am Millie Ayako and this is a sort of digital diary of my (budding) career as a physicist. 

I graduated with B.S. degrees in [physics](https://web.physics.udel.edu/) and [applied mathematics](https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/) from the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/). As an undergrad, I conducted research on opto-electronic and quantum materials with [Dr. Zubaer Hossain](http://www.mdzubaerhossain.com/) and [Dr. Mark Ku](https://www.mkulab.com/). I also had a short but very enjoyable stint on a computational oncology project studying colorectal cancer with [Dr. Gilberto Schleiniger](https://sites.udel.edu/schleini/contact/) and [Dr. Bruce Boman](https://christianacare.org/people/bruce-m-boman-md/).

I am currently interested in photonic materials and devices and their applications to computing and sensing problems. I am particularly interested in applications to optical computing as well as biomedical sensors. I am currently applying to graduate programs for Fall 2023. 

Feel free to get in touch if anything here piques your interest! If you are interested in applying for a PhD and would like to hear about my application process, [check out this page](https://mmayako.github.io/gradguide). I am happy to do my part to make academia more diverse and equitable. If you’d like to learn about me, [check out this page](https://mmayako.github.io/fun/). 


### Recent News 
**Dec. 1, 2022** - All my applications are in so now I just need to wait and see what happens.

**Nov. 6-9, 2022** - I was able to attend my first in person NSBP conference! 


## Undergraduate Research Projects
### Quantum Magnetic Imaging -- Winter 2021 to Spring 2021
In winter 2021, I joined Prof. Mark Ku’s lab group, where we used **quantum magnetic imaging** techniques to characterize **2D magnetic flakes**. I did the hands-on work of building our quantum sensor system based on **nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds**. I later used **MATLAB** to simulate the magnetic field generated by the system when observing samples. We published this work in 2D Materials as [_“Revealing room temperature ferromagnetism in exfoliated Fe5GeTe2 flakes with quantum magnetic imaging.”_](http://mmayako.github.io/files/revealing-room-temp.pdf) 

### Age Structured Population Models Applied to Tissue Dynamics -- Summer 2020
In summer 2020, I was **UD Summer Research Scholar** working with Prof. Gilberto Schleiniger and Dr. Bruce Boman. For my project, I used MATLAB to find numerical solutions for **age-structured population models**. I then used these models to predict how **retinoic acid (RARɑ)**, a metabolite responsible for cell maturation, influences the progression of **colorectal cancer**. My model showed that high RARɑ environments fared better in the long run, matching experimental results. This was significant since metabolites degrade quickly outside the body, making physical experiments unreliable. 


### Electronic Confinement in Quantum Dots -- Fall 2018 to Winter 2020
I joined Prof. Zubaer Hossain’s lab group in the fall of 2018. I worked with a graduate student to investigate the core properties of **alloyed quantum dots (QDs)** to improve the energy conversion efficiency of **solar cells**. I then started my own project where I **optimized the shape and composition** of SiGe and InGaAs **heterostructures** to **maximize confinement potential**. For this, I learned how to use **COMSOL** and **MATLAB** to compute solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation using the **finite element method**. Since previous work studied isolated heterostructures, I independently extended this work through a **cluster QD array** project during an internship at **UD’s Energy Research Institute**. For this, I took advantage of the XSEDE **high performance computing** workshops to optimize my code. My efforts culminated in several presentations, including one at the **APS April 2020 meeting**, and two manuscripts.
