### Service Awards

* UD Department of Physics Climate and Inclusion Service Award 2022
* UD Department of Physics Student Leadership Award 2021


## At the University of Delaware

### Faculty Searches
I participated in two faculty searches in 2021 and will be participating in 4 searches this winter. I will be interviewing candidates as part of the CDEI committee to advise the faculty search committees. This is a really unique experience and I’ve learned a lot by being on the “other side of the glass”. 


### Exhibitor for UD at the National Society of Black Physicists 2022 Conference
I worked with Dr. Ed Nowak to recruit undergrad and grad students to both the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Quantum Science and Engineering programs. 

### Department of Physics and Astronomy, Climate, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity Committee
As a CDEI committee member, I created channels for communication for all levels of the department through climate surveys and reporting resources, as well as provided other physics committees with quantitative CDEI consulting. These efforts resulted in changes such as more diverse colloquium speakers, greater student involvement in SPS and the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Society, stronger channels of communication between various department members, and more holistic interviews for candidates on all levels.

### Society of Physics Students
I served as president of UD’s Society of Physics Students (SPS) for two years. As president, I prioritized reducing the barriers of entry that come with many STEM programs. For example, I collaborated with the Climate, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity (CDEI) committee to cover the costs associated with undergraduate research involvement.
