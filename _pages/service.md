Beyond academics, I have been heavily involved in physics based service projects. Working with undergrads has been the highlight of my time at UD and I plan on continuing this in grad school. 

### UD Society of Physics Students
I served as president of UDâ€™s Society of Physics Students (SPS) for two years. As president, I prioritized reducing the barriers of entry that come with many STEM programs. For example, I collaborated with the Climate, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity (CDEI) committee to cover the costs associated with undergraduate research involvement.

### UD Department of Physics and Astronomy, Climate, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity Committee
As a CDEI committee member, I created channels for communication for all levels of the department through climate surveys and reporting resources, as well as provided other physics committees with quantitative CDEI consulting. These efforts resulted in changes such as more diverse colloquium speakers, greater student involvement in SPS and the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Society, stronger channels of communication between various department members, and more holistic interviews for candidates on all levels.
