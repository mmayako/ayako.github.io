### University of Delaware, Department of Physics and Astronomy 
I have been a physics laboratory teaching assistant for over two years. Instructed labs for several electricity and magnetism courses developed for students ranging from algebra based physics to calculus based electrical engineering to over 300 students total. I emphasized various applications of physics through labs examples such as electrical impulses traveling through neurons and the construction of piezoelectric transducers. Teaching duties included preparing lectures introducing physics concepts, grading lab reports and exams, and creating new lab manuals and rubrics to aid in the transition to online learning due to COVID-19. 

#### Courses Taught
* PHYS202: Intro. Physics II (Algebra) – 2022 Winter (1 section), 2022 Spring (2 sections) ~90 hours of work
* PHYS208: Intro. Physics II (Calc) – 2021 Winter (2 sections), 2021 Spring (2 sections) ~120 hours of work
