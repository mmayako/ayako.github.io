I really enjoy traveling. Right now, I spend some of my weekends exploring the cities up and down the mid-Atlantic. Some of my favroties places include Montclair, NJ and the lower west side of Manhatten. For a fun night, I can't reccomend [Smallz](https://www.smallslive.com/) enough. 

One of my most memorable trips is when I spent the summer in China as a teenager. I was able to stay in Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, and a few smaller cities in between. I was able to do a lot of really cool things like
* tour several palaces including the Forbidden City, the old Summer Palace, the "new" summer palace, and the Jade Spring Hill
* [Climb the Great Wall of China](http://mmayako.github.io/files/ChinaGreatWall.JPG)
* visit several gardens in Hangzhou and a few ancient Buddhist temples 

My family is originally from Kenya and I've been able to visit family there. When we do tourity things, we like the safaris in the Masaai Mara where you can see the big five and some less intense animals like gazelles and and meerkats. Lake Victoria is known for flamingos. In the future, I'd like to make a trip to Mombasa. 

When I'm at home, I like playing [Animal Crossing](http://mmayako.github.io/files/ACMe.PNG).

I've also developed a small obsession with ceramics after taking an art class at UD. My magnum opus so far has been a [25 pound, two foot tall garden frog](http://mmayako.github.io/files/CeramicsFrog3.jpg).
