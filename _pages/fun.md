Right now, I spend my weekends exploring the cities up and down the mid-Atlantic. Some of my favorites include Montclair, NJ (they have really fun film and jazz festivals) and the lower west side of Manhattan (thereâ€™s always a fun show going on at [Smallz](https://www.smallslive.com/) ). 

One of my most memorable trips is when I spent time in China as a teenager. I was able to stay in Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, and a few smaller cities in between. I was able to
* Attend classes an Wangxiang Polytech and live in the student dorms
* Tour several palaces including the Forbidden City, the old Summer Palace, the "new" Summer Palace, and the Jade Spring Hill
* Climb the Great Wall of China
* Visit several gardens in Hangzhou and a few ancient Buddhist temples. 

I hope to revisit Hangzhou again as well as Guangzhou and Hong Kong. 

I developed a small obsession with ceramics after taking an art class at UD. My magnum opus so far has been a [25 pound, two foot tall garden frog](http://mmayako.github.io/files/CeramicsFrog3.jpg). 

When I'm at home, I like playing [Animal Crossing](http://mmayako.github.io/files/ACMe.PNG) and recently started judo.
