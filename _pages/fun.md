I really enjoy traveling. Right now, I spend my weekends exploring the cities up and down the mid-Atlantic. Some of my favorites include Montclair, NJ (they have really fun film and jazz festivals) and the lower west side of Manhattan (there’s always a fun show going on at [Smallz](https://www.smallslive.com/) ). 

One of my most memorable trips is when I spent the summer in China as a teenager. I was able to stay in Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, and a few smaller cities in between. I was able to do a lot of really cool things like:
* Attend classes an Wangxiang Polytech and live in the student dorms
* Tour several palaces including the Forbidden City, the old Summer Palace, the "new" summer palace, and the Jade Spring Hill
* Climb the Great Wall of China
* Visit several gardens in Hangzhou and a few ancient Buddhist temples. Here's the view from atop the Leifeng Pagoda overlooking West Lake

I hope to revisit Hangzhou again as well as Guangzhou and Hong Kong. I also look forward to exploring D.C. once I get start my PhD. 

My family is originally from Kenya and I’ve been able to visit family there. When we do touristy things, we like the safaris in Maasai Mara where you can see the [big five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_five_game)  and some less intense animals like gazelles, meerkats, and many, many birds. In the future, I’d like to make a trip to Mombasa. 

I developed a small obsession with ceramics after taking an art class at UD. My magnum opus so far has been a [25 pound, two foot tall garden frog](http://mmayako.github.io/files/CeramicsFrog3.jpg). 

When I'm at home, I like playing [Animal Crossing](http://mmayako.github.io/files/ACMe.PNG) and recently started crocheting and judo to keep me busy while I wait to hear back from grad programs.
